## General info
A full PowerShell remake of the 1980 classic, the Wizard's Castle.
In addition I have added some new elements to the game.
I deeply enjoyed this game growing up and wanted to make it for a modern programming language.
I chose PowerShell as it gave me an opportunity to program in a language I have grown to love.
Exidy Sorcerer game code originally published in the July 1980 edition of Recreational Computing.
